We have published a portion of the facial emotion dataset on GitHub, along with a Data Usage Agreement (DUA). This dataset includes annotations of various facial expressions, aimed at assisting researchers and developers in conducting studies related to emotion recognition. If you require access to the full dataset, please complete the DUA and contact the corresponding author for access.

The following link provides access to the full dataset for reviewers, for evaluation purposes only. To ensure privacy, this link will be deleted after the paper review process is completed.
